    "* amount of air (volume)\n",
    "* speed of air (velocity)\n",
    "* mass of air (density)\n",
    "\n",
    "and the Wind Power can be calculated from \n",

    "$$P = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho Av^3  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where: $\\rho$ - density of the air, $A$ capture area of the wind, $v$ wind speed <em>[1]</em>\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important variable is windspeed. The area swept out by of the turbine is a constant and the density of air is generally taken as $1.225 kg/m^3$, its vale at sea level at 15 degrees $C$. <em>[2]</em>\n",

    "A German physicist Albert Betz concluded in 1919 that no wind turbine can convert more than 16/27 (59.3%) of the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical energy turning a rotor. To this day, this is known as the Betz Limit or Betz' Law. The theoretical maximum power efficiency of any design of wind turbine is 0.59 (i.e. no more than 59% of the energy carried by the wind can\n",
    "be extracted by a wind turbine). This is called the “power coefficient” and is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C_{p_{max}} = 0.59$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, wind turbines cannot operate at this maximum limit. The Cp value is unique to each turbine type and is a function of wind speed that the turbine is operating in. Once we incorporate various engineering requirements of a wind turbine - strength and durability in particular - the real world limit is well below the Betz Limit with values of 0.35-0.45 common even in the best designed wind turbines. <em>[1]</em>\n",

    "#### Turbine Output vs Winds Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "The curve shows that the turbine starts generateingg power at around 3 $m/s$ - the cut-in speed. Slower wind don't have enough power to make the rotor spin. As wind speed increases, there's a rapid increace in power. The sut_down speed is the speed at wi\n",
