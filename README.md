This repository contains all the files for Machine Learning and Statistics Project, 2020. 

### Subject 

In this project you must create a web service that uses machine learning to make predictions based on the data set powerproduction.csv. The goal is to produce a model that accurately predicts wind turbine power output from wind speed values, as in the data set. You must then develop a web service that will respond with predicted power values based on speed values sent as HTTP requests. Your submission must be in the form of a git repository containing, at a minimum, the following items:

- Jupyter notebook that trains a model using the data set. In the notebook you should explain your model and give an analysis of its accuracy.
- Python script that runs a web service based on the model, as above.
- Dockerfile to build and run the web service in a container.
- Standard items in a git repository such as a README.

### The repository contains the following files:

* ML_server.py - Flask server application 
* requirements.txt - text file with python packages required to run the app
* static - folder contains html pages, CSS, img folder and .dockerignore file. 
* .gitignore - GitHub gitignore file
* MLS_Project_2020.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook file, contains that trains a models using in the dataset.
* powerproduction.csv - data set
* model - folder contains trained models as .pkl files
* dockerfile - file with instructions to create docker image

### Instruction

Follow these steps to run the application

1. Clone repository: https://github.com/Slawak1/MLS-Project-2020
2. Navigate to repository folder 
3. Create Docker image: <code> docker build -t ml_server . </code>
4. Run Docker image: <code> docker -d -p 5000:5000 ml_server </code>
5. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in web browser
6. To stop server display list of containers: <code> docker container ls </code>
7. Copy <code>CONTAINER ID</code>
8. Use code: <code> docker kill CONTAINER ID </code> to stop server 



#### Alternatively
2. Create and activate blank virtual environment with a directory named <code>venv</code>
3. Run code <code> pip install -r requirements.txt</code> to install required Python packages
4. Run Flas server (On Windows):
* <code>SET FLASK_APP=ml_server</code>
* <code>SET FLASK_ENV=development</code>
* <code>flask run</code>
5. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in web browser
6. To stop server return to console and press CTRL+C
